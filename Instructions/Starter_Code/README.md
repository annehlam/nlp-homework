I noticed that a lot of the words that appeared in the Bitcoin articles often appeared in the Ethereum articles as well.  There were several words that showed up in large text on both word clouds, including "chars", "Reuters", "Cryptocurrency", "currency."  I found it interesting that the text size of "Bitcoin" was larger than that of "Ethereum" in the Ethereum word cloud, which means that Bitcoin was mentioned more often in the articles than Ethereum was.  The NER visualizations were interesting to do because it would pick out these entities that it recognized and assign a label to them.
